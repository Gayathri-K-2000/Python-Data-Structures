# Python-Data-Structures

Data structures are important for storing, organising and manipulating data for specific purposes.

They provide easy way of implementing the required operations.

There are two types of data structures:
    1. Built-in data structures
    2. User defined data structures

1. Built-in data structures are classified as: 
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionary
- Sets

2. User defined data structures are classified as:

- Linear data structures

  A) LinkedList
  
  B) Stack
  
  C) Queue

- Non Linear data structures

  A) Trees
  
  B) Graphs
  
  C) HashMaps
  
# Algorithms

- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithm

Other Algorithmic problems are:
- Sorting
- Searching
